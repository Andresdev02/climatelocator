## **What this project does**
The climatelocator API returns climate data from different locations and occured disasters related to climate change in that location.

Possible location requests are: the avarage monthly temperatures, the name of the location and location in geohashes.

Possible disaster requests are: Hurricanes, droughts, floods, wildfires, tornadoes and heat waves.

**See getting started for possible endpoints**
#
## **Why is it useful**
This API can be used to visualize weather and changes in weather, as well as the climate disasters that occured at these locations.

By using this data, there is the possibility to create datavisualisations or simply display any weather information on a website. Furthermore, the data can be used for installations and real-time applications.

## **Project status**
In development.

#

## **Git flow**
Git Flow was used in this project, due to the possible future complexity of the API. Information provided in this project is limited, however, can be expanded by providing more tables of data related to climate change.

When extending the API, the project could take up a large scale. Therefore, it is required to correctly Fork the project on another branch.
