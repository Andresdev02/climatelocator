## **Roadmap and vision**
I envision this API to be widely used amongst developers, researchers and artist. Scientists and researchers, or individuals, who have obtained scientifically proven research, can replenish the content of the database. Because of this, information will always be correct and up-to-date.

Moreover, the API can be used to provide crucial information to the public. Since climate change is rapidly accelerating, it is required to inform about this topic in as many ways as possible. I hope that Artist and developers will share and display information in any form, so climate change gets enough recognition.
